   Most communication with the main driver routine can be done with
   the standard TSSINI and T$$.... variables that exist currently.
   There are some cases where a user defined variable is required to
   be defined to TSSUT. This is done with the VARLIST variable
   in the T$$.... exec.  Each variable named in VARLIST will be
   retrieved via the ISPEXEC VGET service upon TSSUT start up.
   This will allow your variables to be specified in the command
   definition member and automatically passed to subsequent
   routines. A variable specified here however must exist in the
   profile pool, that is it must have been subject of a VPUT
   command.
