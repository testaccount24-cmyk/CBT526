)AREA S1
   TS-Admin uses five main utility datasets which are referred to
   in variables DS1 -DS5 .  The suffix numbers ( 1- 5) are used
   in the edit and browse commands to access the datasets.

   To Browse the datasets the letter B is combined with the
   dataset number you wish to browse, so the B1 command would open a
   browse session with the dataset specified in variable DS1. B2
   would browse dataset number 2 and so on.

   The Edit commands function exactly the same as the browse
   commands E1 is used to edit DS1, E2 to edit DS2 etc.

   The utility datasets themselves are used for a variety of
   purposes as documented below.

   DS1 - Lrecl 80
   This dataset is used for dynamic output, GETBACKUP, LO and CMDO
   use this dataset for output while CONVERT when specified with
   the bypass option uses this dataset for input. Data here will
   be overlayed frequently.

   DS2 - Lrecl 80
   This dataset is used for output JCL that is generated
   independantly of batch mode by the convert command.

   DS3 - Lrecl 80
   This dataset is used for output from the WRITEDEBUG command and
   the MODIFY command.

   DS4 - Lrecl 133
   This dataset is used for any wide data the is generated by the
   system.

   DS5 - Lrecl 80
   This dataset is used for batch JCL generation when in batch mode.
