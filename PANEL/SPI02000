   Listing Acids can be done with one of three delivered commands.
   Each one of these causes a command to be issued to TSS in the
   following format:
        TSS LIST( acid ) DATA( data)
                   |            |
                   |           The panel DATA field
                  The panel ACID field

   The commands are :
   · L       This issues the command directly to the security
      database and the output is displayed on your screen with no
      interference from the panel system. An example is below

      OPTION  ===> L
      ACID    ===> JOHNDOE
      DATA    ===> basic
      DATA2   ===>

      Note that the valid data fields are determined by your current
      security package version, NOT TS-Admin.


   · LS      This issues the command directly to the security
      database and the output is displayed in a scrollable screen
      format.


   · LO      This issues the command directly to the security
      database and the output is routed to a utility dataset, this
      does overlay any current data in the target dataset.
