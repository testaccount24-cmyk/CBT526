)AREA S1
   The screen appearance can be customized to include commands
   that you add to the panel system. Unlike the CORECMD member,
   the screen definition member is column dependent!  There are
   three visible columns on the main panel that are defined in
   the first three fields, starting in columns 1, 23 and 41, and
   an authority indicator in columns 79-80.  The first three
   columns are shown to the user exactly as they appear in the
   screen definition member only if the authorization level of
   the user is equal to or above the authorization level for that
   line in the screen definition. This allows you to customize
   the member so that each level of authority only sees the
   commands that they are authorized to execute.  Be aware that
   the security authority of the command in the command
   definition member and the authority level defined in the
   screen definition member must match, or the user will either
   see options they cannot use or will not see options they are
   authorized to use.
