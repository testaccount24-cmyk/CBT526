)AREA S1

   This command accepts two parameters the function and the list
   of ACIDs.  If BYPASS is specified for the ACIDs parameter then
   DS1 will be used as the input to this exec.  The results from
   this exec are written to DS2 or to the screen if DS2 is not
   available.  Here are the valid values for the function
   parameter:

   Translate:
     This function is used for debugging, when
     specified the exec writes out the translated
     interim data for each ID specified in the
     acidlist. This is excellent for seeing how an ID
     is being manipulated internally. Be aware this
     function writes output directly to the screen so
     you may wish to front end this option
     with some of of output trapping. Like the FSDISP
     exec for example.

    Compare:
      This function compares the permission of each ID
      in the acidlist to the first ID specified in the
      list.

    Rebuild:
      This function creates a stream to recreate an ID
      The stream contains the TSS create command in
      addition to the add and permit commands that are
      generated by the permit function below.

    Permit:
      Exactly the same output as above but with no TSS
      create command for each ID.
    Revoke:
      This creates a stream that would remove all
      permissions from the ID.
