  Commands are defined in member CORECMD in the delivered parmlib,
  and referenced by the variable SRCCMD.  The value of SRCCMD is
  set in the TSSINI Exec.  The command definition member is read
  each time that a user invokes the panel system.  The delivered
  command member will function without any modifications.  Optional
  changes can be made if you need to add commands or change the
  default security requirements of delivered commands.  Note: It is
  always a good idea to make a backup copy of this member prior to
  making changes.  Below is a section of the PARMLIB member
  CORECMD, which defines the CONVERT command to the panel system.
  The first line is merely a comment, while the second line
  actually defines the CONVERT command to the panel system.  This
  member is read in word by word--that is, it is not column
  independent.

  Word 1: Panel Command Parameter (PNLCMD)
  Word 1 on each line is the panel command parameter
  (indicated by the PNLCMD header in the comment).  This must
  be an exact match with the command entered by the user on
  the panel.  For example, the line below will receive control
  when CONVERT is entered on the panel system command line.

  * PNLCMD CMDNAME    MSG    DATA DATA2 AUTH TRAP BATCH  VARS
   CONVERT   TVER.CON  1     0      0    5   ON    2     ACID

  Word 2: Internal Command Parameter (CMDNAME)
  Word 2 on each line is the internal command parameter
  (indicated by the CMDNAME header in the comment). This is
  the command that will be issued by the system itself
  internally to accomplish the work that the user requested.
  This must be a REXX exec, CLIST, or load module available to
  this TSO user.  A special keyword is allowed for this parameter
  only, it is the TVER prefix.  This will be replaced with the
  three-character code, which indicates the security package and
  version level.  For example if you are using TSS version 5.0
  the prefix will be T50, so the actual REXX exec name that will
  invoked here is T50CON.  The TVER variable is set in the
  TSSVERS REXX EXEC. No other variable will be interpreted in
  CMDNAME parameter!

  * PNLCMD CMDNAME    MSG    DATA DATA2 AUTH TRAP BATCH  VARS
   CONVERT   TVER.CON  1      0     0    5    ON   2     ACID

  Word 3: Message Parameter (MSG)
  Word 3 on each line is the message parameter (indicated by
  the MSG header in the comment). This determines whether at
  the conclusion of this command the panel system should
  retrieve the variable SECRC (via an ISPEXEC VGET  PROFILE
  service) and display it on the command line as the result of
  the command.  The valid values here a re 0 or 1.  If a zero
  is specified the return code is dis played at the conclusion
  of the command.  A 1 causes the returned message to be
  displayed.

  * PNLCMD CMDNAME    MSG    DATA DATA2 AUTH TRAP BATCH  VARS
   CONVERT   TVER.CON  1      0     0    5    ON   2     ACID

  Word 4: Data Parameter (DATA)
  Word 4 on each line is the data parameter (indicated by the
  DATA header in the comment). This determines whether the
  data field on the panel must be filled in prior to
  invocation of this command, and, if so, what must be present
  in the field. The valid values here are 0, 1, NUM, CHAR,
  OPTC, or OPTN, as defined in the following table.

  Data Parameter Values for Panel Fields
  Value Definition
  0     Value is not required.
  1     Value must be filled in.
  NUM   Value must be numeric.
  CHAR  Value must be filled with a character value.
  OPTN  Optional value; if specified, must be numeric.
  OPTC  Optional value; if specified, it must be a character.

  * PNLCMD CMDNAME    MSG    DATA DATA2 AUTH TRAP BATCH  VARS
   CONVERT   TVER.CON  1      0     0    5    ON   2     ACID

  Word 5: Second Data Parameter (DATA2)
  Word 5 is exactly the same as word 4 except it refers to the
  DATA2 screen value.

  Word 6: Authority Parameter (AUTH)
  Word 6 on each line is the authority parameter (indicated by the
  AUTH header in the comment). The convert command specifies a 5 a
  s its authority level.

  * PNLCMD CMDNAME    MSG    DATA DATA2 AUTH TRAP BATCH  VARS
   CONVERT   TVER.CON  1      0     0    5    ON   2     ACID

  Word 7: Out-trap Parameter (TRAP)
  Word 7 on each line is the out-trap parameter (indicated by
  the TRAP header in the comment).  The possible values of
  this parameter are ON and OFF and LOG.  When ON is
  specified all output from this exec is suppressed via the
  REXX out-trap facility.  When off is specified any messages
  written are shown to the user immediately.  The LOG option
  in addition to trapping output of the function writes a
  one-line record to the TS-Admin log dataset (specified in
  the LOGDSN variable in TSSINI).  Most functions should
  specify ON or LOG and write debug only messages to the
  screen.  Suppressed messa ges can be viewed with the
  WRITEDEBUG function.

  * PNLCMD CMDNAME    MSG    DATA DATA2 AUTH TRAP BATCH  VARS
   CONVERT   TVER.CON  1      0     0    5    ON   2     ACID
  .
  Word 8: Batch Environment Setting (BATCH)
  Word 8 on each line is the batch environment setting (
  indicated by the BATCH header in the comment  ). The
  possible values for this parameter are 0, 1 or 2 .

  0  -  A value of 0 indicates that this command will not be
  issued in batch mode, but that a record will be written to
  the accrued JCL stream instead. This value is normally
  specified for a command that updates the security database
  directly.

  1  -  A value of 1 indicates that the command is to be
  issued in batch mode and supports a pre-opened batch file.
  This would normally be specified for a command that writes
  multiple updates to the batch file. This setting is used
  rarely and usually indicates a command that is doing a large
  amount of decision making.

  2  - A value of 2 indicates that the command is to be issued
  immediately without respect to the mode with no pre-opened
  batch file. Any command using this setting should be a
  short running command that performs no security updates.

  * PNLCMD CMDNAME    MSG    DATA DATA2 AUTH TRAP BATCH  VARS
   CONVERT   TVER.CON  1      0     0    5    ON   2     ACID

  Arguments Following Word 8
  Words following word 8 are a list of arguments to pass to
  the invoked routine on the command line. There are several
  control char acters that can be included to control how the
  argument string is created.  These control characters and
  their function are given below:
  _     An underscore indicates that any value that follows is
  a literal and should not be substituted.

  <    The less-than sign indicates that any preceding spaces
  should be deleted.

  Example 1: If  these variables are set:
  DSBACK = SYS1.BACKUP
  ACID   = MYID
  DS1    = 'TECH.MYID.C1'
  DATA   =  ABC
  DATA2  =  DEF
  then the variable string below:
  TRAP BATCH  VARS
  ON          2         DSBACK  <_( <ACID <_)   DS1   _SHR
  would be passed as this argument:
  SYS1.BACKUP(MYID)  'TECH.MYID.C1'  SHR

  Example 2: If  the same variables are set:
  DSBACK = SYS1.BACKUP
  ACID   = MYID
  DS1    = 'TECH.MYID.C1'
  DATA   =  ABC
  DATA2  =  DEF
  then the string below:
  __PER( <ACID __) __DSN(SYS1.STUF. <DATA <__. <DATA2 __) __ACCESS(ALL)
  would be passed as this argument:
  per(MYID  )  DSN(SYS1.STUF.ABC.DEF) ACCESS(ALL)
