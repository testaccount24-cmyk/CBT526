   This command inserts the profiles specified in the DATA field into
   the ACID specified at the location in the DATA2 field.

   Note: IF the location is 0 then the profiles will be removed and
   not reinserted.

   For example:
   If this were done:

   OPTION  ===> IN
   ACID    ===> MYID
   DATA    ===> myprof
   DATA2   ===> 3

   Then MYPROF would be added to the ACID MYID in position 3 in
   the profile list. If the ID already has the profile it will be
   removed from MYID then inserted into position 3.
