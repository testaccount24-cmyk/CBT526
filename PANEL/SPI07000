   Deletion of an ACID is a very simple process consisting of one
   command specifying the ACID to be deleted.

   OPTION  ===> DELETE
   ACID    ===> testid
   DATA    ===>
   DATA2   ===>


   A TSS list of the ACID will be taken to the PDS specified in
   the DSBACK variable to the member named for the ACID.
   Example:

   DSBACK =  The.backup.dsn
   ACID   = testid

   The dataset used for backup would be  'THE.BACKUP.DSN(TESTID)'
