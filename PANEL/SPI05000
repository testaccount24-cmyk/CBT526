   The TS-Admin system uses the backup dataset to hold text
   output from a standard TSS LIST command. The list is generated by
   default when an ID is deleted using the TS-Admin delete command
   but an administrator can manually take a backup by issuing the
   BACKUP command.

   Once backed up, the text can be retrieved with the GETBACKUP
   command and used as input to the CONVERT command to recreate the
   ID if needed.
