   Adding ACIDs is done with the ADD command. A sample is below.

      OPTION  ===> Add
      ACID    ===> testid
      DATA    ===>
      DATA2   ===>

   This command causes a data input screen to be displayed
   a section of which is seen below after the fields have been
   filled in. The name must be a valid TSS name ( no single quotes)
   The department must be a currently existing TSS department, and
   the user attribute field, if filled in, must be a valid existing
   authority stream member in the defaults dataset. After specifying
   these values and hitting enter the panel will appear something
   like this:


   OPTION ===>
   Name   ===> New employee           Dept ===> HRDEPT

   Standard user attributes will appear below. for ===> finance
   ===> TSS PER( TESTID ) DSN(TSS.JOBCLASS.Y) ACCESS(ALL)
   ===> TSS PER( TESTID ) TSOACCT(98000)
   ===> TSS PER( TESTID ) TSOPROC(STEPLIB)
   ===> TSS PER( TESTID ) TSOPROC(SPFLOGON)
   ===> TSS add( TESTID ) home('/u/users/$$')


   Any of the authority stream commands can be changed at this point.
   Note that in batch mode the creation stream will be appended to
   your current batch job stream and in online mode the ID will be
   created while you wait.

   Note that the ID will be created with the password specified in
   the NEWPASS variable set in the T$$.... exec.
