   There are two main commands the perform conversion, CONVERT and
   CONVERTRESOURCE, each is explained below.

   CONVERT -
   This command creates a batch JCL stream that would, if submitted
   recreate the ACID in the ACID field. The stream is created in work
   dataset 2.

   Note: This output job must be manually submitted it is not
   subject to the panel "SUB" command. It is assumed that the
   administrator will change the stream. This command will also
   accept the parameter "BYPASS" in the ACID field, in which case
   it will convert the output in the dataset pointed to by by
   variable DS1 ( which should be a list of one or many TSS ACIDs
   ) into a command stream to duplicate the ACIDs.  This command
   DOES support multiple IDs!

   For example:
   If this were done:

   OPTION  ===> CMDO
   ACID    ===> tss list(acids) data(all,EXPIRE,pw) dept(mydept)
   DATA    ===>
   DATA2   ===>

   Then this command were issued:

   OPTION  ===> CONVERT
   ACID    ===> bypass
   DATA    ===>
   DATA2   ===>

   A stream would be created to duplicate the entire department which
   was listed. This command is very handy for moving
   groups from one system to another, or getting command syntax for a
   complicated permit or add command.

   Note: Passwords included in the output stream during a
   "BYPASS" are converted, even though passwords are are NOT
   converted during default convert processing.  To include
   passwords in the output stream a LO or CMDO command would
   normally be used. The EXPIRE data option should ALWAYS be specified
   when generating ouput for the convert command, because without
   it key data will be unavailable to the CONVERT command.


   CONVERTRESOURCE -
   This command creates a batch JCL stream that would, if submitted
   recreate the resource specified in the DATA field. The resource
   type must be specified in the ACID field. An example follows:

   OPTION  ===> CONVERTRESOURCE
   ACID    ===> dsn
   DATA    ===> sys1.linklib
   DATA2   ===>

   This would generate JCL followed by data that looks something
   like this in DS2:

   TSS PER(MVSTECH) DSN(SYS1.) +
        ACCESS(ALL)   ACTION(FAIL)
   TSS PER(STCSUB) DSN(SYS1.) +
        ACCESS(ALL)   ACTION(FAIL)
   TSS PER(DASDMGR) DSN(SYS1.) +
        ACCESS(ALL)   ACTION(FAIL)
   TSS PER(PERFMGR) DSN(SYS1.) +
        ACCESS(ALL)   ACTION(FAIL)
