   Commands can be issued for a group of ACIDs connected to a
   common ACID. This is done by specifying the department,
   division, or profile in the ACID field and the desired command
   to be generated for each ID connected to that ACID in the DATA
   field.  The comand specified must contain the string ' $$ '
   without the quotation marks. This string will be replaced by
   each target ACID generated.  Example:

   OPTION  ===> GROUPCOMMAND
   ACID    ===> MYPROF
   DATA    ===> tss rem( $$ ) suspend
   DATA2   ===>


   The above command would generate a command stream to remove the
   suspend attribute for each ACID connected to the profile MYPROF.
