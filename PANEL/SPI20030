  These two members are REXX execs that set up each user's
  environment at panel initialization, and are re-executed
  when a REINIT command is issued. Values set in TSSINI can be
  overlaid by the T$$xxxx member when it is executed. Changes
  should be made in the T$$.... member whenever possible.
