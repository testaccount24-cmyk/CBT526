   The BATCH command changes your current processing mode to batch.
   In batch mode commands that update the database are deferred and
   their JCL equivalents are written to the JCL stream in DS5.
   How a command is treated in batch mode is determined by its
   definition in the command definition member which is pointed to
   by SRCCMD variable in your TSSINI or T$$... exec.

   Batch mode can be changed to online mode by issuing the ONLINE
   command or by issuing the SUB command. Be aware that the SUB
   command submits the JCL in DS5 immediately then switches the
   mode to online.
