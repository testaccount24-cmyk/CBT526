   This command creates a batch JCL stream that would, if submitted
   change the profile as you specified during the input process.

   Note: This output job must be manually submitted it is not
   subject to the panel "SUB" command. It is assumed that the
   administrator may change the stream.

   For example:
   If this were done:

   OPTION  ===> MODIFY
   ACID    ===> myprof
   DATA    ===>
   DATA2   ===>

   Then this screen would be presented:

   Option  ===>
   ACID    ===> MVSTECH

     Functions are A(Add) M(Modify) D(Delete) S(show details)
    Funct  Type    Resource                               Access

           FACILITY CICSDIV
           FACILITY NCCF
           FACILITY VTP
           FACILITY NDM
           FACILITY OMON
           FACILITY TCPIP
           FACILITY VPS
           FACILITY BETA92


   The lower screen area is scrollable and the option column on
   the left hand side of that area allows you to specify one of
   four commands A (for add) , D ( for delete), M( for modify),
   and S ( for show details).

   For example if the A command was specified for a dataset
   rule of ICFCAT.MVS the following popup would be displayed.
   The specifications made here would be reflected in the JCL
   stream created at the conclusion of this command. Not that
   the A command does nothing to the rule selected it merely
   uses it as a model for a new rule to be added to the profile.

    ---Message Display Service
    OPTION  ===>

    Type     ==> DSN
    Access   ==> ALL
    Resource ==> ICFCAT.MVS
    Library  ==>
    Facility ==>                Until   ==>
    Action   ==> FAIL
    Program  ==>
    Other    ==>


    The M command would cause the exact same popup window to be
    displayed but an additional command would be placed in the
    JCL stream generated. That command is a revoke of the
    selected rule.  So any changes made will replace the selected
    rule.

    The D command causes a revoke to be placed into the JCL
    stream generated, removing the rule from the profile.

    The S command shows the details of a rule but allows no
    updates to be made to that permission.
