)F   TSA519W: xxxxxxxx

  Issuing routine: TSSUT

  Explanation: This message occurs when the MSGOPT of a command in
               the SRCCMD is set to DATA, and the user is in basic
               presentation mode. The DATA parm is used in expert mode
               to return data in the ACID panel field, since there is
               no ACID field in basic mode the additional data will
               overlay the normal message area. This in effect
               prevents this routine from setting a message that the
               user will ever see.

  Action: The debug log will contain the original message the routine
          set prior to the overlay.
