)F   TSA030I: Function completed successfully

  Issuing routine: TSSUT

  Explanation: TSSUT invoked a command that has completed and NOT
               set a completion message. This occurs when a command
               is defined with the MSGOPT of 0 in the SRCCMD
               definition member, or any dynamic command is invoked
               in batch mode.

  Action: No action is required, if your command is setting a message
          and it is not displayed at completion, check the MSGOPT of
          the command definition in the SRCCMD member.
