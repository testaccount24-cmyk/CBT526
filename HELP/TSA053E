)F   TSA053E: Table/screen mismatch, SPIMAIN displayed

  Issuing routine: TSSUT

  Explanation: The TSSUT routine was unable to display the panel
               SPIUTIL because the screen table was not loaded. The
               mode was changed to basic and processing continues.

  Action: This is a mismatch between the scrload variable and the
          panel variable. Insure the scrload variable is set correctly
          and that the panel value is not being changed in your
          T$$ exec.
