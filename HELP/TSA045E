)F   TSA045E: Invoked function returned a code of  xx

  Issuing routine: TSSUT

  Explanation: TSSUT invoked a command that has completed and NOT
               set a completion message.  The command did however
               set a nonzero return code which is mentioned in
               the error message.

  Action: No action is required, if your command is setting a message
          and it is not displayed at completion, check the MSGOPT of
          the command definition in the SRCCMD member.
