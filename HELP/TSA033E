)F   TSA033E: table format not dynamic, screenload not valid

  Issuing routine: TSSUT

  Explanation: A SCREENLOAD command was issued, however the current
               configuration does not use the screen table as input.

  Action: Confirm that the panel you are using is named SPIUTIL,
          any other name will prevent the screen table from being
          used. Confirm that the PANEL variable in TSSINI is set
          correctly and not being inadvertently overwritten in
          the T$$xxxx routine. Confirm that TABLEOPT is set
          to TEMP.
