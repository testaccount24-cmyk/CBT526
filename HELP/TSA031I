)F   TSA031I: function completed with a return code of xx

  Issuing routine: TSSUT

  Explanation: TSSUT invoked a command that has completed and NOT
               set a completion message.  The command set a non
               zero return code which is displayed in the message.
               This occurs when a command is defined with the
               MSGOPT of 0 in the SRCCMD definition member, or
               any dynamic command is invoked in batch mode.

  Action: No action is required, if your command is setting a message
          and it is not displayed at completion, check the MSGOPT of
          the command definition in the SRCCMD member.
