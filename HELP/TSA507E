)F   TSA507E: HIGHUID omvstabs modify failed.. unable to determine
           next uid. HIGHUID terminating

  Issuing routine: HIGHUID

  Explanation: During HIGHUID processing a TSS MODIFY OMVSTABS
               was issued and returned a non zero return code.

  Action: This is probably due to a lack of TSS authority, if
          so any preceding TSS messages should be reviewed.
