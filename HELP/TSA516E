)F   TSA516E: Expert function is unavailable in basic mode.

  Issuing routine: TSSUT

  Explanation: An attempt was made to call an expert level function
               from a basic mode panel which is invalid.

  Action: Invoke the equivalent basic mode function or change the
          expert level function so that it does not pass any of the
          variables ACID DATA or DATA2. Since the basic mode panels
          have no way to retrieve these variables.
