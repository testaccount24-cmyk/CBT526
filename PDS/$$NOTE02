This product has been completely replaced by the author, David
Russell, Aug 6, 2014.  However, because of the difficulty of
translating the text documentation from the new MSWORD doc members,
$INSTDO1, $INSTDO2, AND $CMDSDOC into plain text, I am keeping the
previous plain text members here, and their original WORD source
members.  The ISPF id's on each member should indicate what each
member is, and its status:
