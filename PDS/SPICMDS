SPI Basics

Introduction

The SPI  panel system is a full-screen ISPF-based system that
greatly automates the standard security administrator functions
normally performed through tedious, TSO-based syntax commands.
The system allows you to:

* Edit a profile in a full screen mode.  This feature means you
  can add, modify, and delete permissions quickly and easily.  The
  scrollable interface allows you to concentrate on your
  requirements, not the exact syntax of the commands to be entered.
  Revoking an authority is as easy as specifying a D next to the
  appropriate line.  Standard TOP SECRET commands are created to
  accomplish the work and can be reviewed prior to submission.

* Automate ID additions so that authorities are assigned
  automatically at creation time to ACIDs that require them.  You
  also have the option of assigning a UID to an ID automatically.
  You can specify at creation time the cluster of authorities to be
  given or let the defaults for a department take effect.

* Undelete IDs that were previously deleted.

* Create a JCL job stream to rebuild one or multiple ACIDs from
  standard TSS list command output.  You can then edit or review
  the JCL prior to submission.  This is a very useful feature for
  moving ACIDs from one system to another, or when you need to view
  the syntax of a permit or add command.  You can also use this
  feature to duplicate a profile before replacing it system wide.

* Create a JCL stream to replace one profile globally with
  another and maintain its relative place in each ACID.

* Create a JCL stream to duplicate a permission rule database
  wide. For example, you could create a new set of SYS2 dataset
  rules that exactly matched every SYS1 permission.

* Create a JCL stream to issue any TSO or TSS command for every
  ACID in a department or division, or connected to a profile.

* Secure panel commands with internal settings, if needed.

* Plug your own REXX or CLIST commands into the system.  Each JCL
  stream created uses standard TOP SECRET commands to accomplish
  its function.  Commands that update the database can be queued to
  a batch file for later submission.  This allows an administrator
  to work much faster since there are no TSS interactive response
  time delays.

About This Guide

This guide details the features available to a user of the panel
system.  Effective use of this system requires detailed knowledge
of the TOP SECRET security package installed at your site, and a
working knowledge of ISPF basics.

The Basics of the Primary Panel

The panel system is a TSO/ISPF based system with the primary
panel shown in the following figure:

Panel Description

Line  1     Displays the current processing mode (batch or online).
Line  2     A message area for normal importance messages.
Line  3     The option selection line.
Lines 4-5   A message area for important messages.
Line  7     A static line that precedes the command display area.
Lines below 8   A scrollable command area.  Each line in this
              area represents a valid option for the SPI system.
              Numeric functions invoke additional panels while
              nonnumeric functions are actual commands.

The entire lower area is scrollable; simply use PF7 to scroll up
and PF8 to scroll down as you would in a browse session.

The Panel Environment

Command Modes of Operation:

The panel system has two command modes of operation, online and
batch, with online being the default.  Most commands function
differently in each mode.  To change between modes, enter the
command ONLINE or BATCH.

In online mode the commands that update the security database are
issued and their effect is immediate.  Commands that generate JCL
streams are mode independent and continue to create these JCL
decks.

In batch mode, commands that would normally update the security
database are translated to their JCL equivalent and appended to a
batch JCL stream for submission at a later time.  This allows an
administrator to interactively create the batch JCL stream
without response time delays associated with multiple interactive
updates to the security package.  At the conclusion of a batch
mode session the administrator submits the JCL that was created.

Display Modes of Operation:

The panel system has two display modes of operation, basic and
expert, with basic being the default. The modes change how data
is entered into the command processor, but the actual command
functionality remains unchanged. To change between modes, enter
the command BASIC or EXPERT.

In basic mode each command displays a customized screen for data
entry. This is very helpful for a user who does not use a
function repeatedly or may need some elaboration as to what data
each command requires. The displaying of this additional screen
does slow down the overall process of command entry however.

In expert mode all required data is required prior to command
invocation. This hastens throughput for a user who is familiar
with the functions of the system.

Some commands have an expert mode name and a basic mode name.

The Work Datasets

While using the panel system each user allocates five datasets to
support output of various types.  The size needed for these
datasets varies from a few tracks for a lower level administrator
to several cylinders for the senior site administrator.  Work
datasets are named in variables DS1- DS5, and referenced in the
Bx and Ex commands.

Example:  Work dataset #4 is named in variable DS4.  To edit this
          dataset, use the command E4.  To browse this dataset,
          use the command B4.

Locally Administered Variables

The panel system has several variables that should be customized
to create the proper environment for each user.  Some of the most
common variable values can be viewed and temporarily changed by
using the 0 option.  These temporary changes are in effect for
the duration of the current session, only.  See the SPI
Installation and Customization Guide for instructions on how to
make permanent changes, when they are required.

Quick Reference for Daily Tasks

This section illustrates how to use SPI  to accomplish some of
the day-to-day tasks of a security administrator.  It assumes
detailed knowledge of your current sites' security environment
and familiarity with the panel system commands and their use.

The tasks show how to:

* Back up an ACID or group of ACIDs
* Retrieve a backup of an ACID or group of ACIDs
* Make an exact copy of one owned resource
* Move a large group of ACIDs

Back up an ACID or group of ACIDs

This is one-step function of the panel system, through the use of
the BACKUP command. It is also done automatically prior to a
DELETE command issued through the panel system. This option is
displayed on the backup menu which is displayed by selecting
option 5 from the main menu.

Retrieve a backup of an ACID or group of ACIDs

This is one step function of the panel system, through use of the
GETBACKUP command. It would usually be done prior to recreating a
deleted ACID. This option is displayed on the backup menu which
is displayed by selecting option 5 from the main menu.

Make an exact copy of one owned resource

Issue a RESCON command for the resource to be copied. Edit the
JCL with the E2 command, then change any values you see fit. The
RESCON command is displayed on the conversion backup menu which
is displayed be selecting option 6 from the main menu.


Move a large group of ACIDs

First list the ACIDs to your DS1 dataset through the CMDO command
which is on the group commands menu ( Option 10) ., as shown
below:

SPI ----- MODE: ONLINE ------- SPI Primary Screen --------------------

 SPI OPTION  ===> Cmdout


--------Command output trapping screen -------------------------------

Specify the command as you would under ISPF option 6.

Command text ---> Tss List( ACIDS ) Dept(xxx) Data( ALL,EXPIRE,PW,ACIDS )
                             --->
                             --->
                             --->
                             --->






Then Issue a FULLCON command with the BYPASS parameter to use the
DS1  data you just created as input:

SPI ----- MODE: ONLINE ------- SPI Primary Screen --------------------

 SPI OPTION  ===> FULLCON


--------Convert routine query screen. -----------------
Specify the target ACID(s) or BYPASS to use work DSN #1
ACID(s)         ---> bypass
                      --->
                      --->
                      --->
                      --->
                      --->






This could also be done by using the settings screen ( main menu
option 0 )  and pointing DS1 to a previously existing list of the
ACIDs.

This will create a JCL stream that will recreate the IDs that
were contained in DS1.

The Default Command Functions

See the next chapter for complete information on the default
command functions available from the panel system.

Basic Command overview

The SPI system has one main command line. When a command is
selected a pop up menu will appear to allow you to specify any
additional data the command requires, if needed. Valid commands
are displayed in the lower portion of the screen in the leftmost
column.  The lower portion of each screen is a scrollable area,
so some options may be initially out of view. Standard use of PF7
and PF8 will scroll this lower area.

The presentation menus show the commands in related groups for
ease of reference and use. The user of the system is in no way
limited by the menu currently selected. Any authorized command
may be invoked from any menu of the system.




Settings: Option 0

The settings menu displays some common panel settings and allows
some of the values to be dynamically updated. Below is a screen
picture, all values above the tables line can be updated by the
user. Be aware, an incorrect update here can cause unpredictable
results.

The Basics: Option 1

This option menu contains the most commonly used functions in day
to day ACID maintenance.

They are:

Asuspend -  This function will add the TSS ASUSPEND attribute to
            the ACID specified.
Us       -  This function will remove the TSS ASUSPEND attribute
            from the ACID specified.
Aexpire  -  This function will add the TSS EXPIRE field to the
            ACID specified.
Ue       -  This function will remove the TSS EXPIRE field from
            the ACID specified.
Extend   -  This function extends the ACIDs password for the
            number of days that you specify.
Reset    -  This function removes the expiration, resets the
            password to the installation default, and unsuspends
            the ACID.
Pwreset  -  This function resets the ACID password to the
            installation default.

Listing:  Option 2

These menu commands issue a TSS list command for the ACID
specified and manipulates the output as follows.

LISTO - Writes the resulting data to a work dataset #1.

LISTS - Writes the resulting data to a temporary dataset, which
        is then browsed.

LIST  - Writes the resulting data directly to the screen, in the
        same manner as a native TSS LIST command.



Addition: Option 3

 This menu displays the functions that add an ACID to the
 database and also shows the options to update the STC record.
 These options are:

AddSTC - Adds an entry to the STC record.

RemSTC - Removes an entry from the STC record.

Add  -   This option will add an ACID and allow an authority
         stream to be run to customize the ACID during the
         addition.

During ACID addition the following panel will be displayed.  Use
this panel to fill in the name and department of the ACID to be
created. If a member exists in the defaults dataset of the same
name as the department specified it will be used as a command
stream. If another command stream is required it must be
specified in the command stream line.

---------------- TESTID ADD INFO PANEL   ------------------------

OPTION ===>
Name   ===> George                       Dept ===> THEDEPT

Specify a command stream from the defaults dataset ===> Stream1
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
Enter END ,  X  or  PF 3  to return to main menu


Upon hitting Enter the defaults dataset is searched for a member
matching the stream specified and a command stream is created for
the ID, as shown below:

---------------- TESTID ADD INFO PANEL   ------------------------
 CHANGE DEFAULT COMMAND STREAM IF NEEDED AND HIT ENTER.
OPTION ===>
Name   ===> george                 Dept ===> g1dept

Specify a command stream from the defaults dataset ===> stream1
===> NAME('george')  DEPT(G1DEPT) TYPE(USER) PROF(MVSTECH)
===> TSS PER( TESTID ) DSN(TSS.JOBCLASS.Y) ACCESS(ALL)
===> TSS PER( TESTID ) TSOACCT(98000)
===> TSS PER( TESTID ) TSOPROC(STEPLIB)
===> TSS PER( TESTID ) TSOPROC(SPFLOGON)
===> TSS add( TESTID ) home('/u/users/testid')
===> TSS add( TESTID ) group(mvsgrp)
===> TSS add( TESTID ) uid(0)
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
===>
Enter END ,  X  or  PF 3  to return to main menu

In online mode hitting Enter at this point causes the ID to be
created. In batch mode it updates the DS5 JCL stream with the
above command stream.

Defaults Member for Command Stream

The defaults member ( stream1 ) that was used to create this
command stream looks like this:

DEPT(G1DEPT) TYPE(USER) PROF(MVSTECH)
TSS PER( $$ ) DSN(TSS.JOBCLASS.Y) ACCESS(ALL)
TSS PER( $$ ) TSOACCT(98000)
TSS PER( $$ ) TSOPROC(STEPLIB)
TSS PER( $$ ) TSOPROC(SPFLOGON)
TSS add( $$ ) home('/u/users/$$')
TSS add( $$ ) group(mvsgrp)
TSS add( $$ ) uid(0)

The $$ values above get substituted with the ACID at creation time.

Authorities: Option 4

The authority menu has sub options for the most frequently given
resource authorities, TSO authorities, datasets and DASD volumes.
It also has the options:

Authorize:  This command inserts the ACID specified into the
authority stream of the defaults dataset member specified, and
executes the stream. This function exactly emulates the process
that is done at ACID addition time except this function ignores
line one of the authority stream which is used only for ACID
creation.

Makeauth: This command creates an authority stream using an ACID
as a model for the stream.

Giveuid: This command determines the highest current UID and
gives the ACID the next UID. This function requires TSS modify
authority.

Backup: Option 5

The backup menu has the following options:

Backup: This command takes a text backup of the ACID specified to
your backup PDS. The member name will be the ACID name

Getbackup: This command retrieves a previously stored backup form
the backup PDS and copies it to work dataset #1.


Conversion: Option 6

Fullcon - This function creates a batch JCL stream that would, if
submitted, recreate the ACID specified field. The stream is
created in work dataset #2.

Note: This output job must be manually submitted it is not
subject to the panel "SUB" command. It is assumed that the
administrator will change the stream. This command will also
accept the parameter "BYPASS" in the ACID field, in which case it
will convert the output in the dataset pointed to by variable DS1
(which should be a list of one or many TOP SECRET IDs) to a
command stream to duplicate those IDs. This command DOES support
multiple IDs!

Note: Passwords included in the output stream during a  "BYPASS"
are converted, even though passwords are NOT converted during
default convert processing.  To include passwords in the output
stream a LISTO or CMDO command would normally be used.

Pconvert - This command function exactly the same as the convert
command except it does not produce the TSS commands to recreate
the ACID in the resulting JCL.

Rescon - This command produces a JCL stream that would recreate
authorities for a resource system wide.

Prevoke - This command creates a stream to revoke an ACIDs
authorities.

Resrevoke - This command creates a stream that will remove all
references to the resource rule specified database wide.


 Deletion: Option 7

Delete - This command takes a backup (exactly like the BACKUP
         command) of the specified ACID and then deletes it.

Fastdel - This command takes no ACID backup prior to deletion.

Utility DSN: Option 8

This menu offers options to browse or edit any of the currently
allocated work datasets.

E1 - E5 - These commands edit datasets one through five
          respectively.

B1 - B5 - These commands browse datasets one through five
          respectively.



Profiles: Option 9

Repprof - This command generates a JCL stream that will replace a
          profile system wide.

Insert  - This changes the profile list of an ACID by adding or
          removing one or many (5 maximum) profiles from the ID.
          Prior to issuing this command the proper location for
          the profile must be determined.

Modify  - This command displays a panel to facilitate updating a
          profile in a full screen mode. This command actually
          creates a batch job to do the updates, there are no
          immediate interactive updates performed.

An example of using the modify command is given below.  This
examples uses three options to specify a delete of facilities VTP
and NDM, and an addition of an entry using IMSJES2.  Spool
resource as a model.

At this point you can submit this JCL or change it in any way you
see fit.



Commands: Option 10

Groupcmd - This command generates a command stream that will
issue the same command for each ACID attached to a department,
division or profile ACID.  The substitution string must include
the string ' $$ ' which will be replaced by each ACID to be
targeted by the command.

Cmdout - This option issues a command and routes the ouput to
work dataset #1.

Cmdscreen - This option issues a command and routes the output to
a temporary screen dataset.

Internal Options: Option 11

Batch - This command changes the processing mode to batch. In
batch mode all commands that are issued that would cause changes
to the TOP SECRET security file are deferred, and their
equivalent is written to a batch jobstream. This jobstream is
contained in the DSN pointed to by the DS5 variable. Note that
this jobstream can be submitted sight unseen with the SUB command
from the panel, or you may end batch mode with the ONLINE command
and edit the JCL with the E5 command. Note that exiting and
re-entering batch mode erases the output from your previous batch
mode!

Online - This command changes the processing mode to online. This
command is used after entering batch mode (see the BATCH
command).  The JCL stream that was created in batch in DS5 is
closed and can be edited and manually submitted if needed.  Note
that this JCL stream can be submitted sight unseen with the SUB
command when in batch mode. Note that exiting and then
re-entering batch mode erases the output from your previous batch
mode!

Reinit - This command reloads all defined variables, overlaying
all session customization. It resets the current mode to online,
and reloads the screen and command tables.

Sub - This command changes the processing mode to online, and
submits the JCL that has been constructed as part of batch mode..
This command is only valid in batch mode.

Writedebug - This dumps the debug log to work dataset #3 and
opens a browse session for that dataset.  This command would
normally be used by technical support to help gain information
regarding a problem.  This command is non-disruptive as far as
panel system functionality, but be aware this command will
overwrite the contents of DS3.

Commandload - This command reloads the command definition from
the file specified. Be aware this may drastically change how the
system functions without changing the appearance of the screen.
This command is normally used to test a command definition prior
to utilizing it system wide. This command is only in effect for
the duration of the current session, and can be undone with
another COMMANDLOAD, a REINIT command or exiting and restarting
the system.


STC Interface: Option 13

This screen lists options to modify the running started task and
trap the output for your review.



This panel issues TSS modify commands and traps the output if any.

SPI Expert Mode Commands

Expert mode command introduction

Expert Command introduction

The SPI system in expert mode has a different look and feel than
the basic mode. When most commands are selected they are
immediately invoked, no pop up menu will appear. This results in
commands being dispatched quickly, which allows many commands to
be issued without waiting for the popup menu to input additional
data.

The drawback of expert mode is that since the panel interface
does not change, the user must know what data is required for
each function with a minimal amount of instruction.

Most commands have two ways of being invoked, an expert display
mode version and a basic display mode version.  The differences
being the intervening pop up menus. All basic mode commands will
function in expert mode and vice versa. And a user may switch
between expert and basic as he/she sees fit.

Expert mode fully takes advantage of the CORECMD and CORESCR
members of parmlib to allow customization by the installation.
See the customization guide for details on how this can be done.

Expert Command delivered commands

As mentioned above most basic mode commands have an expert mode
alias by which they can also be invoked. Here is the list of
delivered expert mode commands and their basic mode aliases.

Expert Panel Description

Line 1      Displays the current mode (batch or online), the
            SYSID of the current system, the current TSO ID and
            the time.

Line 2      A message area for normal importance messages.

Lines 3 to 6   Data input areas for commands.

Line 7      A message area for important messages.

Line 8      A static line that contains the column headers for
            the scrollable command area.

Lines below 8  A scrollable command area.  Each line below the
            column headers represent one function that can be
            invoked from the panel.  The three columns of the
            command area are used as follows:

* Column 1 includes the function label, which is a short text
           field describing the command or function to be invoked.

* Column 2 gives the exact command that must be entered on the
           OPTION field in line three to invoke the command.

* Column 3 is a comma-delimited description of the parameters
           that the command accepts.

The entire lower area is scrollable; simply use PF7 to scroll up
and PF8 to scroll down as you would in a browse session.

The scrollable command area gives you immediate access to the
required parameters for any command.  For example, if you wanted
to use the IN ( Insert) command, you would review the parameter
column entry.  It shows the following:

ID, profile , position ( days )
|        |               |
|        |                DATA2 field
|        |
|      DATA field
|
ACID field

This following example indicates that the if you wanted to insert
profile MYPROF into ACID MYID at position 3 for 30 days the panel
should be filled out as follows:

OPTION  ===> Insert
ACID    ===> MYID
DATA    ===> MYPROF
DATA2   ===> 3      30

Note there is no comma between the position parameter and the
days parameter so they both are input on the DATA2 line.  The
parenthesis around the days parameter indicates it is optional.
